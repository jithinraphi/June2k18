Inorder to connect two ec2 instances using username and password without using pem file through ssh
Here's what I did on a Ubuntu EC2:

A) Login as root using the keypairs

B) Setup the necessary users and their passwords with

# sudo adduser USERNAME
# sudo passwd USERNAME
C) Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config setting

For a valid user to login with no key
PasswordAuthentication yes

Also want root to login also with no key
PermitRootLogin yes

D) Restart the ssh daemon with

# sudo service ssh restart
