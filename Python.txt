Python
1)What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.
It is used for:
web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

2)Why Python?
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.

3)Indentation is very important in python.
(i)Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have
been set.
(ii)To combine both text and a variable, Python uses the + character:

Example
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)
(iii)Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python: int,float and complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
Example
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
(iv)Python casting
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable.This can be done with casting.
Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by rounding down to the
previous whole number) literal, or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal 
(providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals
and float literals.

4)Examples
z=1						
print(z)				//z=1
z="jithin"
print(z)				//z=jithin
a="justice"
b="JESSY MARY"
c="rj"
print(a[1])				//u
print(a[2:5])			//sti
print(len(a))			//7
if 5>2:
        print ("5 is greater than 2")			//5 is greater than 2
print(b.lower())								//jessy mary
print(c.replace("r","A")) 						//Aj
d=" Jithin Justice "
print(d.split())								//['Jithin', 'Justice']
print(d.strip())								//It will remove the white spaces in the front - Jithin Justice
