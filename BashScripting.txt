Bash Scripting
1)Bash - History
Bash is nothing but Bourne Again Shell.
It is an open source project which was introduced to replace Bourne shell.It was developed by Brain Fox.
2).bash_profile
It is designed to execute when you login.
When you have already logged in and opening new terminal,in that case you will be using bashrc.
bash_profile is used for setting environment variables,alias etc.
3).bashrc
This only happen when we are going to restart the shell.
4).bash_history
.bash_history is nothing but the history of the commands which was used by that particular user.
5).bash_logout
The last thing it happened when you do exit or logout for whatever terminal which you have connected to.
6)Almost everytime shell scripts will be having the extension of .sh,but it is not compulsory to have so.
#/bin/bash is the shell environment which is required to run shell script.
Exit status are 0 to successful completion and non-zero to failures.
7)Special characters - Quotes and escapes
a)Escaping something will allow to treat what comes after it literally.
b)Single quote is a literal way of representing the literal value of each character in the quote.
8)Using /dev/null
If we are redirecting something to /dev/null,it won't display any output only.
9)Read statement
#/bin/bash
echo "Enter your first name:"
read FIRSTNAME
echo "Your last name is :"
read LASTNAME
echo ""
echo "Your fullname is $FIRSTNAME $LASTNAME"
echo ""
echo "Enter you age :"
read AGE
echo "In next 10 years,you will be `expr $AGE + 10` years old"

Output:
Enter your first name:
Jithin 
Your last name is :
Justice
Your fullname is Jithin Justice
Enter you age :
27
In next 10 years,you will be 37 years old

10)Types of variables(Implicit vs Explicit Definition )
(i)declare -i VAR=10		//Declaring a variable as integer
declare -p VAR			//It will display which type of variable it is
VAR = "jithin"
echo $VAR
output = 0       //Since we have already defined VAR as integer,it is not possible to change it into string.
(ii)declare +i VAR	//Using this we can modify the type of the VAR variable.Now it can be integer or string.						
declare -p VAR 
VAR="jithin"
echo $VAR
Output is jithin
(iii)Once we define a variable as readonly variable,we can't change its type.Only option to do the same
is that close that terminal in which we are working.

11)Arrays
ARRAY=("First" "Second" "Third")		//This is how we define array
echo ${ARRAY[*]}						//This will display the complete output
Output:- First Second Third
Array elements are space seperated not comma seperated.
We can increase the size of the array,but we can't decrease the size of the array.
We can explicity add a new array index to the already created array also.
