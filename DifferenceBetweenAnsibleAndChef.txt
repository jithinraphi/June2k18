Configuration management is the maintaining of a certain state or states across your infrastructure
a)Configuration files called Cookbooks in Chef and playbook in ansible serve two duties,They are
(i)It will tell what to do on a given system/systems
(ii)They are text files that detail the step by step set of procedures to run an infrastructure,they also 
serve as documentation.
Previous problem : Documentary record of their configuration is unknown,that cookbook/playbook solves.
b)Second major advantage is idempotency.

Advantages of Ansible over Chef
1)The source of Truth
Ansible uses the more sensible option of a source control system for its source of truth,whereas in chef,
chef server is the source of truth.
2)Static and dynamic inventory
In the case of Chef,host have to be individually registered to the Chef Server.
Unlike Chef,Ansible can make use of Static and dynamic inventories of the host system.
