AWS Questions
1)I want to configure an S3 bucket so that I can retrieve files that have been deleted from the bucket?
It is possible to safeguard against accidental deletion of files contained in an S3 bucket by enabling both
S3 versioning and root account multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete support for the bucket.

We can enable s3 versioning from the console,but we cannot enable MFA delete support for bucket through console,
it is only possible from AWS CLI.
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket bucketname --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled 
--mfa "your-mfa-serial-number mfa-code"

 Because MFA delete and versioning support are enabled for the bucket, the file should appear to be gone
 but in fact will now have a DeleteMarker file version ID marking the file for deletion.
