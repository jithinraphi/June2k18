Python3 from linux academy
1)History and benefits of Python
First appearance: 1991
Creator: Guido van Rossum
a)Benefits of Python3
Object oriented scripting language
Dynamic and strong type system
Functional concepts(map,reduce,filter etc)
Whitespace delimited
2)In python,comments follow the below pattern
a)Single comment - #
b)Block of comments -
"""
This is not a block comment,
but it will still work when you really need
for some lines of code to not execute.
"""

3)Common Data types
a)Strings
Some examples of Strings
x="pass"
y="word"
print(x+y)			//Output is password
z="aj"*4
print(z)			//ajajajaj
b)Numbers(int and float)
c)Lists
Lists are mutable,it means we can change the value of it.
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[0:2]					//0 to 2nd index,but 2nd index is not included.
[1, 2]
>>> my_list[1:0]					/1 to last,zeroth index is not included.
[2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[:3]						/till 3rd ie.,till 2nd index
[1, 2, 3]
>>> my_list[0::1]					//zeroth to last with the increment of 1
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> my_list[0::2]					//zeroth to last with the increment of 2
[1, 3, 5] 

(i)If we want to add to a list we can use the .append method. 
>>> my_list.append(6)
>>> my_list.append(7)
>>> my_list
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

(ii)Removing items from a list based on value can be done using the .remove method: 

>>> my_list.remove('b')
>>> my_list
['a', 'c', 'd']

d)Tuples
It is immutable sequence type.
We create tuples using parenthesis (( and )) and at least one comma (,): 
>>> point = (2.0, 3.0)
We can use tuples in some operations like concatenation, but we canâ€™t change the original 
tuple that we created. 

4)Conditionals and Comparisons
#!/bin/bash
name = "Jithin"
a = len(name)
print(a)
if a >= 7:
        print("It is too long")
elif a <=5:
        print("It is ok ok")
elif a ==6:
        print("It is correct")
else:
        print("It is too short")
Output:
6
It is correct

b)While condition
count = 0
while count < 10:
     if count % 2 == 0:
         count += 1
         continue
     print("We're counting odd numbers:",count)
     count += 1

c)For condition
#!/bin/bash
colours = ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'orange']
for color in colours:
        print(color)
jithin = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']
for a in jithin:
        print(a)
for color in colours:
        if color == 'blue':
                continue
        elif color == 'red':
                break
        print(color)
		
In the above example,we have used both for loop as well as if loop.

d)Another Example
#!/bin/bash
list_of_points = [(1,2),(2,3),(4,3)]
for x,y in list_of_points:
        print("x:",x,"y:",y)

e)Logic Operations
(i)Not - It is used for negation
(ii)Or - It will work if either of the two statements are true
(iii)And - It will work only if all the statements are true

f)Exercise 1
#!/bin/bash
first_name = "Jithin Justice"
last_name = "Raphi"
age = 27
birth_date = "December 13"
print("My name is ",first_name, last_name)
print("I was born on ",birth_date," and I'm ",age, " years old.")

Output:
My name is  Jithin Justice Raphi
I was born on  December 13  and I'm  27  years old.

4)General Knowledge
a)Using a `while` loop with a condition that will always return `True` will create an infinite loop. There is
no `do...while` loop in Python
b)REPL stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop, and it describes how the code that is typed in is executed.
c)`None` is the constant that represents nothingness in Python. 
d)In Python 3, integer division (`2 / 3`) will return a float.
e)Any immutable type can be used as a key in a dictionary. Lists are mutable because you can add or remove
items from them.
f)You exit the REPL by either running the `exit` function, by using parenthesis, or by using Ctrl-D. 

5)Basic Scripting
a)Reading User input
(i)Example
#!/bin/bash
name = input("What is your name ")
birthdate = input("What is your birthdate ")
age = int(input("what is your age:"))
print("My name is " ,name, " and was born on ",birthdate )
print("Half of my age is ",age/2

Output:
What is your name Jithin 
What is your birthdate Dec 13
what is your age:27
My name is  Jithin   and was born on  Dec 13
Half of my age is  13.5

b)Function Basics
#!/bin/bash
def print_name(name):
        print("Name is ",name)
print_name("Jithin")

Output:
Name is  Jithin

#!/bin/bash
def add_two(num):
        return num * 2
result = add_two(4)
print (result)

In python,by default function doesn't return anything.

c)Using function in Scripts
#!/bin/bash
def gather_info():
    height = float(input("What is your height? (inches or meters) "))
    weight = float(input("What is your weight? (pounds or kilograms) "))
    system = input("Are your mearsurements in metric or imperial systems? ").lower().strip()
    return (height, weight, system)
def calculate_bmi(weight, height, system='metric'):
    if system == 'metric':
        bmi = (weight / (height ** 2))
    else:
        bmi = 703 * (weight / (height ** 2))
    return bmi
while True:
    height, weight, system = gather_info()
    if system.startswith('i'):
        bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, system='imperial', height=height)
        print("Your BMI is ",bmi)
        #print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}")
        break
    elif system.startswith('m'):
        bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
        print("Your BMI is ",bmi)
        break
    else:
        print("Error: Unknown measurement system. Please use imperial or metric.")

Output:
What is your height? (inches or meters) 1.705
What is your weight? (pounds or kilograms) 69.9
Are your mearsurements in metric or imperial systems? metric
Your BMI is  24.045200849665893
