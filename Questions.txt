1)Difference between EBS,EFS and S3
2)Difference between S3 and glacier
3)What are the different orchestration tools
4)How to set a docker image with maximum size of 500mb
You can specify runtime constraints on memory and CPU, but not disk space.
a)docker run -it --storage-opt size=120G fedora /bin/bash

b)Constraints on disk I/O: Various options for setting constraints on disk I/O have been added to docker run:
--device-read-bps, --device-write-bps, --device-read-iops, --device-write-iops, and --blkio-weight-device.

1)What are the different types of deployments in code-deploy?inline and blue-green?
2)What are the difference types of deployments in elastic beanstalk?
3)What are the adv and disadv of inline deployment and blue-green deployment?
4)3-tier architecture?where we should keep application,webserver and database?
5)Routing table entries,Security group entries,NACL entries?
6)Difference between elastic,network and application load balancer?
7)What are the new concepts in ECS?
8)Why to use ECS?
9)How can we deploy a container on a particular instance in a group of cluster which contain 4
 container instance?
10)What are the different parameters in which we can scale in ECS?
11)How auto scaling is achieved in ECS?

12)Difference between COPY and AND?
a)COPY <src> <dest>
The COPY instruction will copy new files from <src> and add them to the container's filesystem at path <dest>
ADD <src> <dest>
The ADD instruction will copy new files from <src> and add them to the container's filesystem at path <dest>

b)COPY is Same as 'ADD', but without the tar and remote URL handling.
c)Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred. 
That’s because it’s more transparent than ADD.
d)Because image size matters, using ADD to fetch packages from remote URLs is strongly discouraged; 
you should use curl or wget instead.
