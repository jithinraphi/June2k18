EFS
1)AWS offers 3 types of storage :- File,Storage and block.
a)Block Storage contains Amazon EBS and EC2
b)Object Storage contains S3 and glacier
c)File Storage contains EFS
Using EFS we can attach to 1-10000's of EC2 instance to it
2)Design of EFS
a)Simple
It is fully managed service
Seamless integration with existing tools and apps
Simple pricing = simple forecasting

b)Elastic
File system grow and shrink automatically as you add or remove files
No need to provision storage capacity or performance
You need to pay for the storage space you use,with no minimum fee.
c)Scalable
Filesystem can goes to petabytes of capacity

These 3 components are the foundations of high availability and high durability.
It is highly available and highly durable.Data is spread across multiple AZ.

3)When to use EFS?
Requires multi-attach 
Multi AZ availability/durability
GBs/Throughput
Requires automatic scaling(grow/shrink)of storage
