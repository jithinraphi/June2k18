1)Kitchen
Use Test Kitchen to automatically test cookbook data across any combination of platforms and test suites:

)Defined in a .kitchen.yml file. See the configuration documentation for options and syntax information.
)Uses a driver plugin architecture
)Supports cookbook testing across many cloud providers and virtualization technologies
)Supports all common testing frameworks that are used by the Ruby community

1a)The key concepts in Kitchen are:

ai)  A platform is the operating system or target environment on which a cookbook is to be tested
aii) A suite is the chef-client configuration, a run-list, and (optionally) node attributes
aiii)An instance is the combination of a specific platform and a specific suite, with each instance
being assigned an auto-generated name
aiv) A driver is the lifecycle that implements the actions associated with a specific instanceâ€”create
the instance, do what is needed to converge on that instance.
av) A provisioner is the component on which the chef-client code will be run, either using chef-zero or 
chef-solo via the chef_zero and chef_solo provisioners, respectively
